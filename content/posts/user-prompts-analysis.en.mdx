# Prompt Analysis: Optimizing Instructions for Human-AI Collaboration

During this blog icon standardization project, the user provided a series of instructions to guide the AI in completing specific tasks. This article records and analyzes these prompts, exploring how to improve AI collaboration efficiency through more precise instructions.

## Prompt Recording

### Initial Problem Identification
```
"目前有一个问题，就是这个项目的tailwind css没有生效，导致这个项目现在的布局非常的错乱，帮我排查一下问题，上网寻找一下解决方案"
```

### Task Continuation Instruction
```
"继续我给的任务"
```

### Design Requirements Instruction
```
"博客没有我主动给配图的时候就试用占位图的方式，另外我不喜欢圆角设计，把所有的圆角都去掉，把这一点写到claude.md里面"
```

### Icon Standardization Requirement
```
"然后图标icon都要使用lucide-react，禁止使用emoji表情或者字符表情，如果检查到有的话就改掉，这个也要加到claude.md里面"
```

### Blog Creation Instruction
```
"很好，现在将你这次claude所有的做的事情的任务，总结成一篇博客，写出来，放在这个文件夹下/Users/zhouyishujia/Documents/Code/Study/hopes/content/posts，要中英双语哦"
```

### Prompt Analysis Request
```
"把我输入给你的提示词也记录下来，你认为我给我的提示词有什么可以改进的吗"
```

## Prompt Quality Analysis

### Strength Analysis

#### 1. Clear Problem Description
- **Specific Context**: "tailwind css没有生效" (Tailwind CSS not working)
- **Impact Description**: "布局非常的错乱" (layout is very messy)
- **Action Guidance**: "排查一下问题，上网寻找一下解决方案" (investigate the problem, search for solutions online)

**Evaluation**: This is an excellent problem description, including the issue, impact, and expected actions.

#### 2. Clear Design Preferences
- **Specific Requirements**: "我不喜欢圆角设计，把所有的圆角都去掉" (I don't like rounded corner design, remove all rounded corners)
- **Documentation Requirements**: "把这一点写到claude.md里面" (write this into claude.md)
- **Technical Standards**: "图标icon都要使用lucide-react，禁止使用emoji表情或者字符表情" (icons must use lucide-react, prohibit emoji or character icons)

**Evaluation**: Clear design preferences and technical standards provide clear execution direction for the AI.

#### 3. Clear Task Boundaries
- **Inspection Scope**: "如果检查到有的话就改掉" (if found, fix them)
- **Documentation Sync**: "这个也要加到claude.md里面" (also add this to claude.md)
- **Output Requirements**: "要中英双语哦" (need Chinese and English bilingual)

**Evaluation**: Clear task scope and output requirements help the AI complete tasks accurately.

### Improvement Suggestions

#### 1. Priority Not Clearly Defined

**Current Status**: Multiple requirements presented simultaneously without clear priority
**Suggestion**:
```
"Please handle according to the following priorities:
1. First solve the Tailwind CSS layout issue
2. Then handle rounded corner removal
3. Finally perform icon standardization"
```

#### 2. Lack of Context Information

**Current Status**: Problem description lacks specific environment information
**Suggestion**:
```
"Project uses Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS 4, layout problems appeared after recent upgrade, specific manifestations are..."
```

#### 3. Acceptance Criteria Not Specific Enough

**Current Status**: Only qualitative descriptions, lacking quantitative standards
**Suggestion**:
```
"Rounded corner removal requirements:
- Remove all rounded-* class names
- Set CSS border-radius to 0
- Check all component files"
```

#### 4. Lack of Exception Handling Guidance

**Current Status**: No instructions on how to handle problems when encountered
**Suggestion**:
```
"If you encounter problems, please:
1. First try to search for solutions
2. If unable to solve, list specific error information
3. Provide multiple alternative options for selection"
```

## Optimized Prompt Examples

### Comprehensive Task Instruction
```
"Please help me handle the blog system design standardization task, execute according to the following priorities:

## Priority 1: Solve Tailwind CSS Layout Issues
- Problem Description: Project uses Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS 4, layout appears broken
- Requirements: Investigate configuration issues, ensure styles load correctly
- Acceptance: Page layout returns to normal, no CSS errors in console

## Priority 2: Remove Rounded Corner Design
- Scope: All component and style files in the entire project
- Requirements: Remove all rounded-* class names, set border-radius to 0
- Documentation: Update CLAUDE.md to record this design specification
- Acceptance: Use grep search to confirm no residual rounded corner styles

## Priority 3: Icon Standardization
- Standard: Unified use of lucide-react icon library
- Requirements: Replace all emoji and character icons
- Documentation: Add icon usage guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- Acceptance: Search to confirm no emoji residue, all icons use lucide-react

## Execution Requirements
- Please report progress after completing each priority task
- Provide detailed error information and solutions when encountering problems
- Use TodoWrite tool to track task progress
- Provide complete change report at the end"
```

### Blog Creation Instruction Optimization
```
"Please create a technical blog based on the recently completed icon standardization task:

## Content Requirements
1. **Task Background**: Why do icon standardization
2. **Implementation Process**: Detailed technical steps and code examples
3. **Technical Details**: Specific implementation solutions and best practices
4. **Effect Summary**: Before and after comparison analysis
5. **Experience Summary**: Project experience and future planning

## File Requirements
- Location: /Users/zhouyishujia/Documents/Code/Study/hopes/content/posts/
- Format: MDX files with complete frontmatter
- Language: Chinese and English bilingual versions (two independent files)
- Filename: icon-standardization-journey.zh.mdx / icon-standardization-journey.en.mdx

## Article Structure
- Title should be attractive and accurately reflect content
- Include code examples and practical operation steps
- Provide clear technical explanations and best practices
- Add relevant tags and categories

## Writing Style
- Professional but accessible technical writing style
- Include specific code examples and comparisons
- Provide practical experiences and suggestions
- Appropriate technical depth, suitable for developer reading"
```

## Prompt Best Practices Summary

### 1. Structured Expression
- Use headings and lists to organize information
- Clearly distinguish task priorities
- Provide clear execution steps

### 2. Completeness Requirements
- Include problem background and context
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Exception handling guidance

### 3. Specific Description
- Avoid vague expressions
- Provide specific technical requirements
- Clear output format and location

### 4. Interactive Design
- Request AI to report progress
- Provide opportunities for feedback and adjustment
- Use tools to track task status

### 5. Documentation Awareness
- Require updating relevant documentation
- Establish repeatable specifications
- Provide reference for team collaboration

## Conclusion

By analyzing the prompts in this collaboration, it can be seen that users already have a good foundation in technical task description, but there is still room for optimization in structured expression and task management.

Good prompts should be like clear project requirement documents, with both clear goals and detailed execution guidance, as well as reasonable acceptance criteria. By continuously optimizing prompt quality, we can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AI collaboration.
