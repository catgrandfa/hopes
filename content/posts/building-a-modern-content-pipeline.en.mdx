## Why a content pipeline?

Publishing a couple of posts by hand is easy. Sustaining a consistent cadence across multiple authors and languages is not. A modern pipeline helps us:

1. **Structure content** with MDX so components and snippets are reusable.
2. **Localize quickly** by storing Chinese and English versions side by side.
3. **Automate deployments**—merge a PR and let CI/Lint/Build handle the rest.
4. **Stay observable** by shipping logs and analytics for each post launch.

## Organizing sources

Each article follows the `slug.locale.mdx` pattern and defines metadata in the frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: "Building a Modern Content Pipeline"
slug: "building-a-modern-content-pipeline"
locale: "en"
tags: ["Content", "MDX"]
---
```

This keeps URLs stable while allowing us to filter by locale directly on the server.

## Automation flow

1. Open a pull request—CI runs `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` immediately.
2. GitHub Actions runs `pnpm build` to confirm the App Router bundle succeeds.
3. Deployment triggers a Supabase function that refreshes the sitemap and RSS feed.

## Wrap up

With fewer manual steps, we can invest more energy into writing thoughtful posts and nurturing the community.
