## Color system

We anchored the design in a warm, reading-first palette. All tokens live as HSL CSS variables so Tailwind utilities automatically inherit them:

```css
:root {
  --background: 32 60% 96%;
  --foreground: 26 37% 18%;
}
```

Dark theme variants simply override the same variables, avoiding duplicated selectors across the codebase.

## Dark mode toggles

Tailwind 4 ships `darkMode: 'class'`. Client components toggle the `document.documentElement` class via system preference listeners or a manual switch, keeping rendering predictable.

## Accessibility wins

- Maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio between text and background.
- Provide `focus-visible` outlines for every interactive element.
- Lean on semantic HTML and augment with `aria` attributes when needed.

## Motion and delight

Animations should be subtle and purposeful. Hovering a button adds a soft ring to highlight focus. Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` and fall back to instant state changes when users request it.

## Takeaways

Design systems evolve with feedback. Staying token-driven keeps us nimble enough to update color, typography or spacing without chasing individual components.
