## Introduction

As a developer constantly seeking productivity improvements, I've been exploring various AI programming assistants. The recent launch of Zhipu AI's GLM Coding Plan caught my attention - offering AI programming services starting from just $3 per month with access to the GLM-4.5 model across multiple programming tools.

After extensive testing, I'm sharing my comprehensive experience with this programming subscription service.

## What is GLM Coding Plan?

GLM Coding Plan is Zhipu AI's subscription service specifically designed for developers, featuring:

- **Competitive Pricing**: Monthly plans from $3-$15, significantly more affordable than other AI programming services
- **Advanced Models**: Powered by GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air flagship models
- **Wide Compatibility**: Supports 10+ major programming tools including Claude Code, Cline, and others
- **Strong Performance**: Claims coding performance comparable to Claude Sonnet 4

## Supported Programming Tools

The GLM Coding Plan currently supports these major programming tools:

1. **Claude Code** - Intelligent terminal programming assistant
2. **Cline** - VS Code extension with intelligent code completion
3. **Roo Code** - Lightweight programming assistant
4. **Kilo Code** - High-efficiency coding tool
5. **OpenCode** - Open-source coding tool
6. Additional compatible tools are continuously being added

## Setup and Configuration Experience

### Getting Started

Setting up GLM Coding Plan is straightforward:

1. **Account Registration**: Sign up on the Zhipu AI platform
2. **Choose Plan**: Select your preferred programming subscription
3. **Get API Key**: Create an API key in your dashboard
4. **Configure Tools**: Set up the API in your preferred programming tools

For Claude Code, the configuration looks like this:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="your-api-key"
```

### Real-world Usage Experience

After several days of intensive testing, I found GLM-4.5 performs impressively in programming scenarios:

**Code Generation Capabilities**
- Accurately understands requirements and generates appropriate code
- Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks
- High code quality following best practices

**Debugging Assistance**
- Quickly identifies code issues
- Provides clear solution approaches
- Offers detailed explanations of error causes

**Refactoring and Optimization**
- Practical performance optimization suggestions
- Reasonable refactoring proposals
- Maintains code readability

## Performance Comparison

Compared to Claude Sonnet 4, GLM-4.5 shows:

**Strengths:**
- Significant price advantage (approximately 1/7 the cost)
- Strong Chinese language understanding
- Better localized service and support

**Minor Limitations:**
- Slightly less capable in some complex algorithm scenarios
- Room for improvement in English technical documentation comprehension

## Plan Recommendations

Zhipu offers three subscription tiers:

1. **Basic Plan** ($3/month) - Suitable for individual developers with light usage
2. **Professional Plan** ($9/month) - Ideal for daily development work
3. **Premium Plan** ($15/month) - Best for heavy users and team collaboration

For most developers, the Professional Plan offers the best value proposition.

## Conclusion

GLM Coding Plan provides an extremely cost-effective AI programming solution for developers. While it may not match top-tier models in every extreme scenario, its performance is more than adequate considering the price point.

It's particularly suitable for:
- Budget-conscious individual developers
- Small to medium development teams
- Developers who need Chinese language support

If you're looking for a high-value AI programming assistant, GLM Coding Plan is definitely worth trying.
